Create the SSL Certificate
We can start off by creating a directory that will be used to hold all of our SSL information. We should create this under the Nginx configuration directory:
sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/ssl

Now that we have a location to place our files, we can create the SSL key and certificate files in one motion by typing:
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.key -out /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.crt

client SSL certificate
openssl s_client -connect 192.168.0.9:3002
copy the key from begining to end and paste into the .crt file, that you mapped in the site-enabled conf file.

Some of the issues:
centos nginx connect() to failed (13: Permission denied) while connecting to upstream

It looks like it was SELinux that was causing the problem and getting me to see a 502 Bad Gateway page.
